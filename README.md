# LDA_text_miniing
version 0.1

Text mining using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)

The tutorial and first step for me was to follow [this article](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/08/beginners-guide-to-topic-modeling-in-python/?fbclid=IwAR2FS4JheuH1TWWAILOqNtvybpAYD8U_y2RMWhrzymNgRLCWpXmxnn8rFU8)

get_topics.py includes the GetTopics class that can be used to pull 
articles from The Herald's Business page. This should work on other 
Herald pages by just changing the url class object.
